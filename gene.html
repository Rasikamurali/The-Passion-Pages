<h1>Overview</h1> 
<p>Genetics is the study of heredity and inheritance. The first theories regarding genetics was quoted by Plato and Aristotle, 
but scientific backing to debunk these theories came about only after Charles Darwin failed to answer several questions about 
evolution and when Mendel's paper of pea flowers had been rediscovers in the late 1800s and early 1900s. <br> 
Over here we will discuss the journey that brought about our understanding of the Gene- an fascinating part of our anatomy 
that has several answers as to why we are the way we are. <br> 
Several scientists contributed to this study from Darwin, Mendel and Morgan to Watson and Crick. 
<br> It would be an impossible task to cover all scientists and all aspects of this journey hence only Mendel's findings
followed by the Dobshavzy's results and how genetic science became the founding tool for political propaganda, and the 
final structure of DNA will be discussed here.

<br> 
<p>Charles Darwin was a natural observer. So when the opportunity to travel around the world and categorize species came about, he was the perfect person. Charles made compelling notes 
in several journals that he owned and that was the birth of his "theory of revolution". </p>

<br>
<p>After having failed to pass examinations to become a teacher, Mendel returned to the monestary where he was taken in and tended to his plants. 
He was a natural experimenter and used a several acres of land to find a mathematical ratio that would describe the nature of selection and reproduction. His work however would be regarded
by the scientific world only after three decades. </p>
